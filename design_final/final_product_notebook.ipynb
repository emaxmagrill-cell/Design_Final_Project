    "This is my final infographic on the analysis of the success of teams with respect to their Quarterback's injuries and availability. This project shows how teams perform when their quarterbacks are injured and how they perform when their quarterbacks are available. Teams with quarterbacks who are injured perform much worse than teams with quarterbacks who are available and this is shown through the data and analysis in this infographic. There are four plots above in the final product with annotations to explain the data and analysis. The first plot is a grouped count plot showing the counts of games played by the starting quarterback and their team's wins throughout the season. The second plot is a scatter plot comparing the games played by the starting quarterback and the quarterback's passing EPA (expect points added) with the color the points representing the team's wins. The third plot is a free form graphic created in google slides comparing specific quarterback's careers and the effect of their injuries on their teams performance. The final plot is bar chart displaying the percentage of starting quarterback in playoff teams that started 16+ games across years in the NFL. Across all these graphs and analysis it is clear that teams that have a injured quarterbacks perform much worse than teams with quarterbacks who are available and this is shown through the data and analysis in this infographic."
